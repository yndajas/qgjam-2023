# Gay Ray

Pilot a rainbow ship as you embark on a mission to promote the gay agenda. Fire
your gay ray at the cishets and heteroflexibles to convert new baby queers to
the cause. Build solidarity to strengthen your resistance against the
heteropatriarchy, but watch out: if your solidarity level falls too low, the
straights might take over ðŸ˜±

Made for [The Queerness and Games Jam 2023][qgjam-2023]

## Playthrough

## How to play

You can play the game on the web, or download a copy for macOS, Windows or Linux
at [yndajas.itch.io/gay-ray][itch-io-page]

Note that - due an issue with the engine - the web build may be slow to load on
macOS, and may stall the first time an effect is rendered. It should play
without issue once loaded and after rendering the first effect. The desktop
macOS app should run without issue
