# Gay Ray

Pilot a rainbow ship as you embark on a mission to promote the gay agenda. Fire
your gay ray at the cishets and heteroflexibles to convert new baby queers to
the cause. Build solidarity to strengthen your resistance against the
heteropatriarchy, but watch out: if your solidarity level falls too low, the
straights might take over ðŸ˜±
